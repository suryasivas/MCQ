#### [02] A Train Running at the speed of 60 km/hr crossed a pole at 9 seconds. Find length of the Train in meter?
  - 150m
  - 600m
  - 100m

### Explanation :-
    Speed = Distance / Time

    Distance =Speed x Time
  
  #### Here they give speed in km/hr and time in seconds so change km/hr(speed) to km/s they Ask answer in meter so its good to convert 'km/hr to m/s'
    1 km = 1000m

    1 h = 3600 s

    So 1km /h = 1000/3600 = 5/18 

    60km /h = (60 x 5) /18 
  
  Solution :
  
    Distance(Length of the Train) = (60 x 5 x 9) /18 = 150
    
  ## ANS: 150

#### [03] A Benz car travel 50% faster than Hyundai car. Both start at same point at same time and reaches end point at the same time and Both car cover 75km. On the way, however, Benz lost about 12.5 minutes on stopping in a station. the speed of the Hyundai car is? 
  - 100 km/s
  - 120 km/s
  - 90 km/s

### Explanation :-

    Speed = X

    Speed = Distance / Time

    Time = Distance / Speed
  
  For Hyundai:
  
    12.5 = 75 / X
    
  For Benz:
    
    12.5 = 75 / ((X x (100 + 50)) / 100)
    
    In the above Equation Hyundai car's speed is X which is 100 %. Benz is 50% faster than Hyundai. So 50 +100 = 150. Since it is in percentage we divide by 100. So we got ((X x (100 + 50)) / 100)

  To find the speed(X) negate Benz car's Equation to Hyundai's Equation.
  
    [75 / X] - [75 / (X x 150) / 100)] = 12.5
    
    [75 / X] - [(75 x 2) / 3X] = 12.5
    
    [75 / X] - [50 / X] = 12.5
    
    1/X [25] = 12.5
    
    Convert Minutes into seconds
    
    25 / x = 12.5 / 60 
    
    25 / x = 5 / 24
    
    X = 24 x 5
    
    X = 120 km/s

#### Speed of Hyundai car is 120 km/s.

## ANS: 120 km/s

#### [04] A is two years older than B who is twice as old as c. If total ages of A,B and c is 27. Find the age of B?
  - 10
  - 27
  - 12

### Explanation :-

    A = B + 2
    B = 2 x C
    C = B / 2

    A + B + C = 27

    B + 2 + B + (B / 2) = 27

    2B + 4 + 2B + B = 54

    5B = 54 - 4

    B = 50 / 5 = 10
  
#### Age of B is 10
## ANS: 10

#### [05] The captain of foodball team of 11 members is 27 years old and vice captain is 3 years older than captain. If the ages of these two excluded, the average age of the remaining players is one year less than the average age of the whole team. What is the average age of the team?
  - 30
  - 27
  - 24

### Explanation :-
 
    Captain = c = 27

    Vice Captain = v.c = 27 + 3 = 30

    Average Age = avg = X

    11X - 27 - 30 = 9(X-1)

    11X - 57 = 9X - 9

    11X - 9X = 57 - 9

    2X = 48

    X = 24
  
#### Average Age of Whole Team is 24
## ANS: 24

#### [06] Two students are appearing at an examination one of them secure 7 marks more than the other and his mark wad 55% of the sum of their marks. What are the marks obtained by them? 
  - 38.5 and 31.5
  - 30 and 45
  - 45 and 55

### Explanation :-
  
    Consider two students as A & B

    A = B + 7

    A - B = 7

    55% - 45% = 10% => 7 [Given in Question, One person secure 10% or 7 mark more than other] 

    Total marks = X

    10% of X is 7

    (10 / 100)X = 7

    X = 70 {Total Mark}

    55% of 70 = 0.55 × 70 = 38.5 

    45% of 70 = 0.45 × 70 = 31.5

## ANS: 38.5 and 31.5

#### [07] A property was originally on a 66 years of lease and two third of the time passed is equal to the four fifth of the time to come. How many years are there to go?  
  - 30
  - 66
  - 36

### Explanation :-
 
    Time passed = X
    
    Time come = y
    
    X + y = 66 -------------> (1)
    
    x[2/3] = y[4/5]
    
    X = y[4/5] x [3/2]
    
    X = y[6/5] -------------> (2)
    
    Apply equation (2) in (1)
    
    y[6/5] + y = 66
    
    6y + 5y = 66 x 5
    
    y = (66 x 5)/11
    
    y = 30
  
## ANS: 30

#### [10] A and B inverst in a business in the ratio 3:2. If 5% of the total profit goes to charity and A's share is 855, the total profit is?
  - 860
  - 1500
  - 1000

### Explanation :-
    Total Profit = X
    
    If 5% goes to a charity then remaining is 95% 
    
    Total share is 3 + 2 = 5 [3:2]
    
    [95/100]X x [3/5] = 855
    
    X = 855 x [5/3] x [100/95]
    
    X = 1500

  
## ANS: 1500
